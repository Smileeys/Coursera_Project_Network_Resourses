Flipping through the pages of the old photo album, Martina paused at the one with the faces 

in the specific one that looked so carefree.

 The expressions so genuine and filled with happiness and energy.

She got lost so much deep in the satisfaction and fulfillment of the thoughts that she felt

as if she is able to relive those good old days in the present times.

The corners of her mouth curved up in a smile as she remembered the excitement and

the little girl’s laughter running around the little yard when she got caught during a game of hide and seek.

It echoed the entire space .All the running during the tiresome playtime made the little one jump up in the arms

of her father and holding him so tight as if for dear life.

The innocent giggles, the sweetness of the times everything appeared so real even after decades.

Martina took a candid photograph of the moment somehow very moved by the sight and wanted to treasure for life.

They were the dearest ones in her life, her husband Carlos and her daughter Clara.

This is how it was 21 yrs ago. The little 2 storied house was full of life .The front porch, the garden

 filled with colorful flowers that beamed with joy. The leaves joined in the celebrations, danced in the

 waves of delight and in amazement of the morning light.

 The natural reaction to the memories of the zone made her look towards the window in the front where she was sitting .

This place gave a clear view of the garden.

She noticed it appeared dark at the time even though it wasn’t even past afternoon or maybe it was her impaired vision .

She was no longer a young girl , she is 58 years now.

She stood up and went closer the windows and looked out .

The phone rang after some moment.

It’s her daughter Clara ,now married  ,making the old woman’s face glow up and smile bright.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The whole house reminded her of her daughter. The belongings raised a jolt of pain and remorse in her heart.

 The warmth had lost somewhere, leaving them all freezing in the pages of the past.

Her husband passed away a year before, leaving her all alone, lonely.

Clara was 19 when she moved out to go to university.2 years later she left again but this time not alone

 but with her newfound love (a husband 5 years older than her, whom she met during college).

Just as the word of disapproval went out of her mouth, her daughter looked at her with pain and watery eyes and

then turned around and left not saying a single word, not putting up a fight.

Carlos and Martina tried to get in contact with them but they were unable to reach them.

The light and the life were snatched right away, at that very moment when her daughter left;

 silently cutting all ties with her parents.

Darkness replaced the space and flooded in despair.

The shelves of books, the crafts of little Clara everything is still intact coated in

layers of dust and gloominess and seemingly forlorn.

The walls, the window-blinds, artifacts every single piece of furniture and corner of the house, lacked all of its glory.

Martina realized, the place where she stood now, had long stopped being a home.
