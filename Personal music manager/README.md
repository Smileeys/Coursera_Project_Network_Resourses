# Personal Music Manager

The objective of developing this project is to simplify the Music collection in the music library.
For this the first thing is to create a database which could centrally handle the details and information about the music as mentioned and the data set would be easily accessible to the user as per his/her needs or the kinds of sorting the user wants.

In this system, there will be two kinds of users who can access the database â€“ one will be administrator who can perform all kinds of operations like insert, update, alter, delete etc. on the database and is responsible for the maintenance of the database. And other users can only access the database who can only view the database but cannot perform any operations as administrator.

In this project, we will have the tables for artists, genre, frequency of playing, rating, popularity, date of release in market, latest release, albums etc. and we will connect these tables to each other to get the complete set of data per the user requirements of sorting.
