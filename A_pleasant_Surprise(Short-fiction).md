The huge lush green grounds of Roseberry college was noticeably bustling with students ,at that beautiful autumn day.
It’s the start of a new session .Hence all the rush.Within them was Menmoli ,21 years old, average height ,slender, fair,brunette with a persona that reflects her Asian lineage. Adding to it is her sense of style and the way she carries herself.She is good in academics as well.
Skimming through the packed hallways, she managed to reach the classroom way ahead of time.
Being the only one,she casually slid into a corner seat in the front row .Wasting no time,she pulled out her sketchbook,  and immersed into carving yet another one ofher numerous secret masterpieces.
The sound of people approaching  the said room, signaled her and she let out a sigh murmuring  to herself “Finally,the wait is over!!” .
A group of students , 11 of them(only 4 girls and all boys), delightfully entered the room.
She muttered again “That’s A whole football team” and grinned at her own little joke.
Her eyes lit up when she realized it was a mixed group and she looked in admiration.
“What about a dozen?” said a deep but friendly voice.
Menmoli startled and shifted her gaze to her left.(wall on the right)
Apparently she spoke too loud for them to hear ,she thought thus resulting in  10 sets of eyes
shooting daggers and glaring at her.
“Wait!!Where’s the other one?”—she pointed out immediately as she noticed .
“Right here,Miss Speaker”---answered the same voice.
Mapping the gaze of others ,she turned back to lock her eyes with the ( most beautiful set of
hazel eyes blessed with yet handsome face and good looks of the) owner.
A few of the members let out “a playful coughing sound” while some were smirking and whistling.

Menmoli blushed a little and uttered in a bit of playful confusion in her expression-- “ Not a bad idea(smirking,thinking-out-loud) but I don’t play soccer( playful pouty-face)”
The group bursted out in laughter and  she looked at them ,narrowing her eyes inconfusion.
(stifling laughter) Joel(a member) said “It’s not about you but Jax’s(Juan Estes) reaction”
“It’s rare to find him at loss of words” --a girl named Daisy added
Another girl plopped on the seat right beside ,introducing herself as Callie & others.
Hunter & Liam jumped on Jax’s side and started teasing him at his “dumbfounded & surprisedexpression”.
He was embarrassed (or "was he blushing").
Menmoli stood up to face Jax (taking everyone by surprise) and said seriously
“I wouldn’t mind being an EXTRA!!” ---a bit of seductive tone in it.
The girls squealed & clapped ,the boys cheered.
Menmoli carried on “For the time needed for him to recover from this shock”(matter-of-fact)
Students continued filling in the classroom,clearly enjoying the conversation till an announcement notifying the Head Professor’s visit was made .
All were listening carefully ,maybe that’s why nobody noticed Jax getting up and leaningtowards Menmoli.Right when the announcement was over he said in a hushed tone---“That’s a pleasant surprise”
Leading to yet another “staring-into-each-other’s-eyes” moment , he smiled and spoke a bitlouder (seeking  group’s attention) just after
“I will rather choose to never recover then”.
The Professor walks in at that very moment.
Everyone was so happy and giddy .(Mistook that to be a greeting gesture)
Professor thoroughly encouraged them to keep their spirits high ,wished the best for all and left after a couple of minutes. 
4 years of togetherness and counting, till date it serves as their treasured inside joke and source of laughter.
