 Attending a lecture, when you are not the so called teacher’s pet is kind of difficult.

It starts with you enrolling in an institution.

You enter the classroom for the very 1St time with a feeling that your experience will last a lifetime.

But hey! Slow down!! .

 Lots of new faces, you interact with some of them, picking out the one’s you will like to be friends with, etc.

 During such phase; the professor walks in.

You look up to see, not one but a whole bunch of your  expectations getting shattered and stomped on, all at one, at that very second.

This should have warned you of the impending disaster.

 But you choose to stay as positive as possible and have patience, but you are yet to get even more surprises.

 Those surprises that will put you back to reality.Anyways,you get accustomed  to all other activities there.

But that’s not the point .You see that just  being a good student , is not enough to score well or even pass.

All thanks to the undocumented but exclusive rules of the teacher’s and being their favorite; so that you are not doomed.

Well, Relax!!! That’s not all, there is more to it.

It starts like this; your tutors will be kind and nice to you at first. Then they get friendlier and too partial regarding matters involving you.

This attracts disgusted looks and stares from your peers. You lose friends and eventually left with none.

To be looked upon as Teachers -pet wouldn’t have sounded too bad if you were, grade I student .But this is not primary school,it’s College. That’s unacceptable.

Given the awfully awkward situation, you are now into; it gets even more tumulus when the  teachers (middle-aged married men with kids) starts making perverted advances.

Subtle at first and next giving birth to countless situations that you find yourself alone with them, excuses like meetings, discussions and likewise.

The advances then escalates to be more direct (i.e. intentionally touching your arms, face etc) .After 1 such incident, you brush it off considering not to over think.

Then it happens again, you back off and manage to escape this time.

Jolting back to reality ,you  acknowledge and analyze, what has been happening  to you all along.

You get severely traumatized after you reach home.

 You even decide to skip classes the next day, then one, then another and when it reaches the one-week mark, your parents  intervene.

 They ask the obvious things like ” Are you okay? What’s going on?” .After being subjected to some more of these inquisitions, you ultimately break down in front of them and speak out everything.

They listen to you in utter shock, supports and stands by your side.

By this time you have reached such a weary mental condition, that you are not even capable of functioning properly. The harsh revelation starts compromising your sanity.

You realize the fact that , it’s upright ABUSE.  Abuse of Power ,  violation and taking advantage of the innocents. You start to hate and loath yourself for not recognizing this earlier,even considered  self-harm or even exhibit suicidal tendencies.

On the flip side,

If you really want to be refrained from all these mess and elect not to be  the teacher’s favorite and not to lose your dignity in the hands of the criminal minded sociopaths.

Then, it’s high time, that you speak up. Speak up against those Predators. Stand up and Raise your Voice against ABUSE.
