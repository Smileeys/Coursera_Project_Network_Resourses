Cindy could hear voices, not one but multiple, hushed tones of
many more; she could feel the presence of people around her,beeping noises of equipments too.She tried opening her eyes with the best of her ability and strength.After struggling some more, her eyes fluttered open.Quite many people were around her in what seemed to be in medical uniform; Doctors, Nurses Etc.She was confused and decided to ask “Where she was and why?”But no words escaped her mouth .Defeated; she just blatantly stared at them.They checked her pulse, noted some more data and then left.Cindy with no other option left, continued to stare dejectedly up at the ceiling of the hospital room and noticing all the details she could.Her head hurt, visions appeared and lost in a flash, her sights seemed blurry and resisting it, made her feel exhaustion.In no time, she yet again zoned out.Several hours passed, till she regained her consciousness for the2nd time. This time she thought she was alone in the room.Through the corner of the eye, she saw a nurse dozing at the seat near the doorway. .Cindy looked at the chair which was frayed with the wear and tear.Next she averted her gaze to take in the entire room.It was devoid of beauty as she had hoped. Walls were cream, not peeling or dirty, just a plain cream shade. No decoration except the limp curtain on the solo window to her left.Perhaps it was once the shade of green, she wondered. The color that used to remind people of spring time and lifted their spirits and hope.
But with time, they too faded as much as that the hue appeared so insipid.Cindy wasn’t feeling any better with all the dullness around and tired due to the immediate activity, dozed off.She had no idea how much time had passed since then. But somehow she felt better.Her oxygen mask was removed freeing her from the feeling of discomfort.She wanted to smile, even though she was in such a state.She again looked towards the doorway, only to find herself alone.She then diverted her gaze and realized that the room was exactly an undertone of bleach and the floor actually was grey.At the far right end, was the window in brown metal frame only opens able at the top.That day the blinds were rolled over to one side giving the view of the outside, even though only a scoop of the morning sky and warmth of sunlight.She felt the need to move her head, ever so little from the usual stiffness but could not.Oh how she wanted to restrain herself and disregard the mortifying objects, essential and could naturally found in the hospitals/medical facilities.Strands for intravenous drips and monitors (of many sizes andlook) populated the room.She was getting anxious and tried to shift her attention to any other left-out aspect.Near the door where the seats were placed, she spotted 2 things:a dispenser and Sanitizer.
These only reinforced the fear of germs and she wondered what if the nurses forgot to wash and clean properly each and every single time they worked with the Unwell.She wanted answers.She tried to remember something; anything but whenever she tried hard she was tormented with dizziness, weakness and ultimately subjected to giving in to the tiredness, retiring back to the world ofunconsciousness.It happened couple of times in the past weeks but seemed to be controlled after she tried not to pressurize herself and stress out her brain.Eventually she understood of the changing pace of monitoring.Being frequently visited by medical professionals, some tried talking to her.A middle-aged Asian Doctor was her regular visitor .
Dr.Bosu as the tag suggested .He seemed kind and was quick to  understand any shift in her expression. He reappeared with even more people, and again after, a couple of similar instances and struggle, she found her Voice .It was now the 3 rd day of the 4 th week that she finally be able to get answers.
