A death trap

Tanya Morris,a 31 year old brunette ,
a recovering alcoholic
Who lives in NYC , with her co worker( at the beauty salon )and best friend Cindy Myers.

Cindy is a year younger than her,tall ,slender and blond who is also the reason for the soberness in Tanya's lifestyle .

Tanya is driven by the desire to be rich and would do anything for that.
 She takes up certain jobs like drug dealing and stuffs of that sort in order to save up for her goal.
But little did she knew her obsession with money will lead her in such a gruesome fate.
Cindy constantly tried to convince her to cut all ties with the illegal deeds and to start living a peaceful normal life.

Inspite of Knowing that Cindy being her wellwisher,Tanya suspected that her friend must be  jealous of her happiness and prosperity .
A drastic change of pace happens when Cindy suddenly goes missing and an opponent gang blackmailed Tanya to step into the path of destruction.
 Tanya was not that evil, she loved her friend ,so,she gave in .
She had left with no other choice.
Furthermore,the gang executed a deadly attack on Cindy and her(when they were walking back home that night) weeks prior to the abduction, as means to show her the consequences if she didn't agree to do the work.
Helpless,she agreed to meet them only to learn yet another horrifying  truth. The abductors informed that She had only 24 hrs to do the work and if done successfully they will not bother Cindy or else she will be subjected to tragic death.
 No foul play can be done because she had been injected with a poison that will slowly degrade the body from inside and thus causing death by infection.Investigation thereafter will not give rise to any form of suspicion or abuse but certainly conclude it as death by natural cause.

 She was instructed to extract a document from a restricted area of laboratories .


It was in the heart of the city,skyscrapers and office buildings lined up gracefully throughout the region and streets with people in business suits.


She was issued fake ID to fool the secured systems, so that she could trespass without leaving trace .

She had to be professional and smartly excute the task given .
It was risky and even if she got caught the gang wouldn't be traced.
She will probably be dead by then.

She reached the designated spot where she overheard the scientists discussing about their ongoing research and understood the document is actually a formula that could revive someone in coma.
Adding to that discovery she learnt that , in this early stage, it is deadly as poison and needs to be protected from going to the wrong hands.

Tanya was there terrified, as to what destruction she was about to give rise to.
But she did it and with the clock ticking the 24 hr limit ;she still had to hand the item over to the Gang in order to protect Cindy.
Millions of thoughts running through her mind, she rushed out of the elevator and bumped into someone.She hastily grabbed her things and ran to the cab .
 She struggled to breathe ,pain coursed throughout her body and the poison danced through the veins making her numb.
There was no way she could reach the intended spot with the limited time left .She got out of the car and called the gang informing the whereabouts, ultimately giving in to the impending death .


As she got tormented with pain,tears in her eyes ,
she prayed to the almighty for justice to be served to those affected by the impending disaster to strike (she could only imagine);
and 
 drifted off to a deep sleep,from which she will never wake up from.
