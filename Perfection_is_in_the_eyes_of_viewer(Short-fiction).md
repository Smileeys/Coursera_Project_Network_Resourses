The desire to reach perfection can take the best of me in certain situations and this was one of those times, I faced it graciously .Being a Computer Science student with a passion in Fashion Designing landed me a job in a   High end store.Customer's requests can sometimes, become hard to pinpoint & that's when I start my work with. A customer had ordered a customized veil but all the demands followed didn't satisfy her thus keeping workers in dilemma. Now, it's high time and I had to provide in depth analysis and also  understand the requirements beyond what is specified by the client.  Material,types, patterns,dos & don'ts; failed to woe her 2 times.  I noted down everything Starting, from when The Order Was placed and communications since then.This was needed to understand the customer,because the stores policy forbade  direct contact with customers ( if new, intern)  and I was new.That made sense for a high end fashion boutique .So I looked for another approach and found what I needed .The following is what I deduced from the customers interactions i.e. the person concerned is intelligent but indecisive ,expressive but also unappreciative, priviledged but emotionally disturbe.The truth happened to be bitter  (but that's the point)but she herself had no clear idea of what she really wanted,humble at first but rude and cold the next.This is not the last 2 design,It may be her conscience that makes her adamant to exercise control whatsoever. Thus I produced a simple design with  pattern that  could almost go with any kind of dress ,yet  Subtle & elegant. Although my team was doubtful or worried maybe but anyhow they made it( they  had, no other choice )and Guess what? It got approved by the client and she was ecstatic.  I guess my ability proved itself.
