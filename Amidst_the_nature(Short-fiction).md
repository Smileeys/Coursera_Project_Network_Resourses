The place where she lived during her infant years and all throughout her teenage years,was a peaceful suburban area.

The close knit community was moderately populated with pleasant weather.

Amidst the serenity of nature and blessed with seasonal variations, the place had its own richness which led to the diversities and beautification.

The mornings started with the sweet melodies of the birds, the warmth and the touch of the rays of sunlight and hope.

She lived there with her grandparents, her mother and her aunt.

 They were the people who cared and loved her, who always wished and did the best for her.

 They were her family, she was fortunate enough to be with.

The landscape and the climate shaped the emotions and nurtured the little girl’s imaginations and provided the ability of gentleness that left its impression as the reflection in her expression.

Above everything that marks this phase of her life was the affection of her mother and the times spent with her in the house.

This was how the place was like, where the girl lived most of her life, grew up and as a result of the extreme proximity with the environment, she inculcated the love for nature and its beings.

It was her grandparent’s house. Though appeared to be a bit small for being inhabited by five occupants,

they all lived happily and cherished the life together. 

Furthermore, that was what that made it even more memorable and special.

It taught her the worth of relationship and the value of family and life.

The best part of the experience was the comfort, the satisfaction and the peace of mind that the place delivered.

She searched for this feel of coziness when she moved out afterwards, but

Hadn’t found a single place like that elsewhere, not even closely similar to it.

The one storied two-bed room home was surrounded by garden with different kinds of plants.

During spring time it looked even more gorgeous with the colorful band of flowers  and

 the ombre shades of the leaves during the advent of fall lined the path right in the front where 

the main door was, which again led it’s way to a massive stretch of green land.

This was the most happening place in the community .It served a variety of purposes, 

may it be someone birthday celebrations or reception, festival or cultural programs.

But apart from those, it generally served as the playground for the kids all year round.

Here the elderly met and relaxed, youths gathered for a chat and some were even there who 

simply just enjoyed the view, some even lay down on the well maintained grassland and read

 storybooks and many of the people just strolled around and relished the feel of the evening breeze.

The days are long gone but whenever she looks back to the good old days,

She felt a strong urge if she could turn back the time .She desired to walk down the memory

 lane to the place where everything was so beautiful and nice, 

where the sky was painted in blue, full of twinkling starlight.
