STORY

 

Cloud grazed the entire sky, just exactly what he was feeling at the moment.

All the hard work, all his sincerity and loyalty he had towards the relationship.

Everything broke down in a matter of seconds, all at once. (A)

 

 

3 years, the 3 years came crashing down in front of his eyes.

All the fights, all the reasons of those fights,

 every time he was accused of something ( even though he was the one to resolve and compromise each of those times) everything.    (B)

 

 

He was devasted, he was shattered. His entire body went numb .He struggled to breathe.

The toxic surroundings wasn’t helping either. All those disgusted faces, chanting words of shame forced him to drag himself out of the space.

The space that once used to be his place of solitude, his contentment, good or bad whatever

might be the situation, he felt safe there.

But now it seemed to had transformed into a monstrous cave engulfed in

darkness.

Darkness of thoughts, Darkness of words, Darkness of Lies, Darkness of despise.

Tears came gushing down his cheeks, the salty taste of sorrow mixed with

 the bitterness of agony.

He was betrayed, cheated and embarrassed in front of all of them.

Those people, with whom he had nothing to do with.

Those ones with whom he never wanted to deal with.

He could hear the mumblings, the stares, and the confusions on the faces of the passerby’s.

Some even enquired if he was okay or in need of any help.

But he didn’t care; he didn’t want anyone to care, not anymore, not ever.

He wanted nothing but to be disentangled from this immutable misery.

He scurried across and stopped near the park, went straight ahead of the border of the playgrounds, behind

the fences, the furthermost corner that marks the boundaries of the property lying next to

the high walls of the massive estate.

The demarcation spot in between them.

The abandoned backside of the grounds which once used to be his only

Companion, the place where he used to sneak in and hide from the people around.

It now looked strange; long grasses, weeds and clearly horrific

 even in the daytime.

 Further back, stood the poles of the old, worn out swing-set.   (D)

 

 

 

This was the place that used to be his playground.

Away from those children of his age, who played together on the other side of this

estranged area, and, all alone!

He couldn’t understand the disgust, the hatred he received from everyone.

He wanted to know what was wrong but he had no one to talk to. People loathed him.

His only friends were the bugs and his own dreary fate.

But, He hoped for a better day.

He wished for a day when he will manage to eat food and drink clear water,

get a shelter and even have someone to love/to get love from.

Even in those days of starvation, desolation and struggle for survival; he never stopped

hoping. He never stopped dreaming, never stopped thinking positively for the future.

Future was the Hope to his Salvation.

He was just a kid then, a 5 year old homeless kid.

He also wanted to feel the joy of having friends, the warmth of love and

Establishment of a family.

He wanted to be one of them. He wanted to be a part of their games but no one

Ever reached out to him or accepted him to be around them.

This was 15 years ago.

Still, today it feels as if nothing has changed, as if Time had tactfully preserved

Every bit of his life, the longings still alive in this little scrap of the field, keeping

The kid in him intact signifying those days.

The last time he came by this place happened to be over 5 years or more (he could not

remember it clearly.)

Maybe he never thought to return there.

Maybe he thought that the visits should end for good.  (C)

 

 

 

But, he was wrong.

He came back.

He had to …..

 and now sitting in the cold, weary and weathered rock on the

elevated portion of a broken see-saw stand,

he was in utmost need to reflect upon his life.        (E)
