THE CONVERSATION 

 Officer Burke was trying really hard to convince Ruth to sign an agreement after his recent  visit to the scene(suburbs with a dead woman's body being discovered ). It started at the time when he was just going   to go through the contents of the handbag that was found beside the corpse... but a knock on the door with a comparatively relieved Ruth on the other side made him push aside the work to resume it back afterwards. 
 She informed that, after  48 hrs of restraining in the Cell, a single phone call proved her identity and is verified by family and relatives along with presenting the supporting documents  and thus on these grounds she is finally declared free and could at last return home.  
He seemed to be happy but something struck (as for a connection, he could sense between the 2 cases. The  prolonged experience in this field and his avid investigator instincts kicked in and almost kind of pressed him to not strike out the possibilty of condition that could turn out  highly dangerous than it apparently seems).

 He took  his departure with her towards the department's  dispatch office for performing the formalities required (as the final grant of permission).

 His proposal, obviously, seemed odd and kind of pressurizing to Ruth and she couldn't understand that 'what a computer programmer would be of any use /what is it, that required to sign Something or even cooperate with the Cops and why bother her life, when clearly she is not in any way  associated with any suspicious act/ bad deeds' .
 Burke was highly experienced and saw this coming,so he calmly in a Compassionate manner  with his ever so convincing  voice, told about the ID that is not lost but swapped and he was about to explain further more, when they heard a sound of something shuffling .

 It was officer Archer Pitt (aka Archie) a middle (New character) aged    Junior cop ,who happened to come across the pair having the conversation regarding some ID Lost.He tried to hear to find out what was all about , hiding behind the decorative Bushes in the back of the Dispatch Department .
Through the tiny crack of a window, he Saw officer Burke & the woman who was reportedly been accused previously as alias of some bad deeds (her connection with bad things), but that's kind of gross and Archer thought of that as over exaggeration by the old cop.
That's not the crucial matter though  ,but he overheard them talking about some kind of agreement and Burke requesting Ruth for any future assistance or cooperation in case 'certain' situation arises.

 Archer, was furious with this old man's Sense of acquisition and selection of team members(Wondering why he never gets selected) but he also was certain of the fact that even if he hold a grudge for Burke, he is a really a good and capable cop.   
He tried to understand the reason, but too involved in his own  ( brainstorming )thoughts, he accidentally was about to trip (but instead he managed to get very close to the bushes lined in the panel of the back window of the room.
 He sensed and saw through the little crack on the wooden window, the conversation reaching to a sudden halt due to the shuffling sound emanating as the result of his eavesdropping mission. 

  And he in haste and fear of getting caught in the act made his way out of the scene towards Officer Burke's chamber.
 On the table laid a hand bag (ladies) with a pair of gloves (that they normally use for detecting objects from any crime scene). 
 He was intrigued but he was not dumb 'for Gods sake he himself has some years of relevant experience'.
 He quickly connected the stories of the ld and Man !!
was he successful in understanding the old Burkes point of view... and the Corcern .
On this realization ,he wasted no time and dived in his pocket to extract his own gloves and started rummaging through the contents & Guess what he found!!
 The ID... Yes , you guessed it  right, the Id in the first place of the woman Ruth , who she reportedly and continuously kept telling  about Whenever she was questioned about the incident. Now, it does indeed makes sense.

 Ruth Jones ID that had been swapped is found on the spot from where officer Burke returned with another women's bag containing it. 
 Thus the Case of Lost & Found is ruled out.  
But he wondered why it should malter anymore, as to making a big deal of a simple thing that happens to all the time but was somehow confident and sure about 
 WHY THE OLD MAN WAS INTERESTED IN TAKING A SIMPLE NORMAL GIRL IN A TEAM OF COPS, IF HE DIDN'T PERCEIVED ANYTHING OF IMPORTANCE. 
Whatever it might be so,he Sat down on the chair . ..
 With Ruth's ID in his hand and with a huge grin planted in his face, he started thinking of the possible ways to use this newfound information against the old Burke.
