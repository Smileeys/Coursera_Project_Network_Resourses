A PLEASANT SURPRISE
 ________________________________600 words __________________________________________________
It’s the new session and the massive grounds of Roseberry college was bustling with students of the Fall Semester. Menmoli ,a 21 year-old , medium heighted south-east asian brunette with decent performance records skimmed through the packed hallways. She reached ahead of time ,sat in the front row right next to the door . Wasting no time,she pulled out her sketchbook and began working until she heard people approaching, let out a sigh murmuring to herself “Finally,the wait is over!!” . A group of 11 students comprised of mixed ethnicities and orientation delightfully entered the room. “That’s A whole football team” she muttered and grinned at her own joke. “What about a dozen?” said a deep male voice. Startled she wondered if she spoke too loud for them to hear . Anyways,turning her head,she met with glares and angry faces. “Wait!!Where’s the other one?”—she pointed out instead. “Right here,Miss”---answered the same voice. Mapping the gaze of others ,she looked behind only to lock her eyes with the handsome stranger . Few started “coughing playfully ” while others smirking and whistling. Menmoli uttered in response--  “ Not a bad idea(smirking) but I don’t play soccer( playful pouty-face)” The group bursted out in laughter which made her look at them in confusion. (stifling laughter)  Joel said  “It’s not about you but Jax’s(Juan Estes) reaction” “It’s rare to find him at loss of words” --a girl named Daisy added Another girl plopped on the seat beside  ,introducing herself as Callie & others. Hunter & Liam joined in and started teasing Jax at his “dumbfounded & surprised expression”. Menmoli stood up to face Jax (who seemed a little embarrassed)and taking everyone by surprise said “I wouldn’t mind being an EXTRA!!” ---in a seductive tone. Jax gulped ,nervously . The girls clapped ,the boys cheered.  “For the time needed for him to recover from this shock”---she added Students continued filling in the classroom,and then an announcement informing the Head Professor’s visit was made . All were listening carefully ,maybe that’s why nobody noticed Jax getting up and Right when the announcement was over he said in a hushed tone ---“That’s a pleasant surprise” Leading to yet another “staring-into-each-other’s-eyes” moment , he smiled and spoke a bit louder thereafter (scrutinizing look, seeking group’s attention) “I will rather choose to never recover then”. Everyone was so happy and giddy . (Mistook that to be a greeting gesture)The Professor thoroughly encouraged them to keep their spirits high ,wished the best for all and left after a couple of minutes.  4 years of togetherness and counting,  till date it serves as their treasured inside joke and source of laughter.
