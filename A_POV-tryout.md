"POINT OF VIEW" 

FIRST PERSON                                                                                

Flash lights blazed ahead , almost blinding my sight and piercing through the darkness of the surroundings .

Along with it , I could hear the loud sound of horns  that seemed to disembowel the impenetrable silence of the highway on which I  was driving on.

Unexpected as it was , and accompanied with  a flurry ,I somehow managed to identify the stiletto of a big-sized vehicle approaching in my  direction. Even before I could process anything further, my little 4 seater vehicle was lethally thrashed by the truck dashing towards my car (in a lightning fast pace)from the other side of the poorly lit highway.

Almost frantically I attempted to reach out and tried to get a hold of the stirring wheel (so that I could stir my way to any of the sides of the road).

But unfortunately, It was now too late to react .

With a screeching noise and a frenzied squeal of the wheels , the car flipped and jerked implacably .The windshield imploded and thus showering the insides with the deadly dance of the breaking glass fragments ;all at the same time. The silvers pierced through my skin leaving deep cuts , blood oozing out from them.

Panic stricken and helpless , I was in state to submit to my fate.

The massive blow proceeded to inflate the safety bag and the  constant thrashing movement ,  ripped away the seat belt I wore (it needs to be mentioned that the force with which I was holding onto it tight , for the sake of dear life adds to the matter too).Just then the car rolled for the very last time.

 With the final grunting howl , I was thrown out of the vehicle .

Loud shriek of Shock and Pain escaped my lips this time.

Almost instantly ,my body  slammed, hitting my head due to  the fatal contact with the concrete and blood emanating out as a result.

Everything was over. My existence wiped away just in a matter of seconds.

I was gone forever ,bidding adieu to the mortal world.




OMNISCIENT
 A blinding set of flash lights blazed ahead, piercing the darkness of the surroundings .

Along with it , came the heavy sound of horns  that seemed to disembowel the impenetrable silence of the highway. Even though in a flurry , Gina somehow managed to identify the stiletto of a big-sized vehicle approaching her direction, in a fleet of seconds. And even before she could process anything more, her little 4 seater vehicle was lethally thrashed by the truck dashing towards her car (in a lightning fast pace)from the other side of the poorly lit highway.

Almost frantically she attempted to reach out and tried to get a hold of the stirring wheel (so that she can stir to any of the sides of the road).

But unfortunately, It was now too late for her to react .

With a screeching noise and a frenzied squeal of the wheels , the car flipped and jerked implacably .The windshield imploded and thus showering the insides with the deadly dance of the breaking glass fragments ;all at the same time. The silvers pierced through her skin leaving deep cuts , blood oozing out from them.

The massive blow proceeded to inflate the safety bag and the  constant thrashing movement ,  ripped away the seat belt she wore (it needs to be mentioned that the force with which she was holding onto it tight , for the sake of dear life adds to the matter too).Just then the car rolled for the very last time.

 With the final grunting howl , Gina was thrown out of the vehicle .

Loud shriek of Shock and Pain escaped her lips this time.

Almost instantly ,her body  slammed, hitting her head with the fatal contact with the concrete and blood emanating out as a result.

Even before help arrived, everything was over.

 Gina was gone.

Moments later when the smoke subsided,

 She was still there , laying on the side of the road, lifeless

in a pool of her own blood.
