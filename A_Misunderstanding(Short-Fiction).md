In Search of her identity is a journey of a simple girl Ruth Jones who is faced with

exceptional turn of events ;losing her ID & then kept as a suspect by the regions police and eventually proceeding to take part in the mission to chase and catch the real culprits.

When working as a part of the mission, Ruth's suggestion to maintain a normal disposition like taking up a regular job 

would help prevent suspicion and it was highly praised by the authorities. She started working in a book store owned by an elderly couple. The Felony's had been running the store for many decades and was respected in the neighbourhood. 

As a means to get the job ,Ruth told them the reason she shifted here as to cope up from the breakup with her 4 years relationship and in order to start afresh.The couple believed her story and welcomed her with open arms .They loved her as if they were here own family yet far from home.

Ruth felt guilty of the lies she told but she couldn't find any other way to deal as regards to the situation concerned .

But soon that changed,when their granddaughter 'Elisa Connor' returned.

Even though they never spoke much (if at all,it was Ruth trying to strike up a conversation but in vain ),she had a feeling that she is not at all welcomed by the person concerned.

The way she looked at her was strange ,her dress up was kind of odd(pairing a skirt with hoodies and slippers) and her overall demeanour was anything but not a bit close to be called "welcoming ". Even when she spoke (with customers or others,which might be the reason Ruth is now employed as the receptionist in the store),

was filled with rudeness and with a stern look on her face.

Getting along was difficult with now the bookkeeper colleague and Ruth was far more invested in her life's events ( the legal aspect )to investigate further into "the Elisa story " but her curiosity was about to be dealt with .

                          ------

One day at noon while working in the store,I got a phone call from the Police department regarding the commencement of the assignment in a few days and was asked to collect the secret message from a crew member (details that will not be exchanged over the phone ).

I excused myself from the store signalling to the network issues and went to the other side of the lane(a little beyond the lane opposite to store) where the exchange was done with.

The rest of the shift went well apart from the occasional glances from my co-worker making me uneasy and kind of self conscious.

I was called by the owners after the store closed and reaching there I noticed something was off ,something was different.

The couple were furious and angry (Not in the happy-go-lucky mood as always ),Not even returned my greetings and smile.

Mrs. Felony asked (with a stern ' no nonsense' tone) to speak the truth .

Ruth asked 'Whats the matter?What went wrong?' surprised to which the old man told her to be honest and tell them the truth that I was hiding from them.

I went numb ,tears forming in the eyes and fearing the worst,I mumbled something and broke down in front of them.

...After some monents I felt someone kneeling beside me on the floor and touched my arm making me realise and recognise who that was.

I looked up to see the person I least expected to show concern for me ever.. ,it was Elisa.

She asked me not to worry or fear and that whatever might be the problem that is going on with the cops can be solved.

That's when it all started making sense.

The phone call,the visitor in Police Uniform

had actually made them worry and concerned about me.

The couple were now thoroughly interested to know and put up with anything that is bothering their grandchild.The old man added that they believe me and trust me and also know that I can not do nothing wrong.

Elisa helped her up,took her to the couch and offered water .Then she told something that made Ruth change the way she thought and importantly the impression she actually had of this person ,Elisa.

It turned out that after her divorce from an abusive 7 years of marriage with an ex -policeman( now serving imprisonment ),the once lovely and lively lady is facing something strikingly similar to what exactly Ruth has been feeling all along.

The battle of trust and regaining the faith in one's own self that shapes the identity of them.

And to that Ruth wiped away the tears and assured them all that nothing is wrong and she has no involvement of the bitter sort with the cops.

She bumped into the officer while speaking on the phone and the mobile dropped causing the personnel to enquire of any damage caused .

They all seemed relieved at this and that's how Elisa and Ruth became the best of friends.And The dealing with the police force that calls for a different story.

I would love to know your  feedback and any suggestions that will help in improving the story.
